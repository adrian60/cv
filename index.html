    <p>Tisch <strong>University</strong><em> Professor</em></p>
    <p>
      I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms
      and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information
      systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been
      supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a
      MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
      Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
      Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
      Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
      Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
      Arts and Sciences.

      <li>
        In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences
        in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an
        introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of
        ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.
        <ul>
          <li>
            This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
            entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
            introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
            support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
            with optional advanced sections.
